## Introduction

Elapse is an AI-driven chatbot for Discord designed to streamline the development process. By focusing on a single language framework at a time and allowing you to merge various language learning models (LLMs), Elapse delivers specific, accurate, and relevant information to help you manage your projects effectively and efficiently. You'll experience the empowerment of customized support and the security of our code masking process.

## Our Unique Approach

Traditional AI chatbots can lack specific depth when they are trained on multiple languages and frameworks. To overcome this, Elapse introduces a unique approach where our chatbot focuses on one framework at a time. The resulting Language Learning Model (LLM) provides developers with highly accurate and relevant information. Moreover, Elapse allows developers to merge multiple LLMs, creating a customized support system proficient in the chosen languages or frameworks.

## Data Collection & Security 

Elapse ensures the privacy and security of your code through a process called code masking, which transforms your original code into an untraceable format. This masked code is then processed by our AI-powered LLMs, and the response is converted back into a human-readable format. All these operations occur locally, adding an extra layer of security.

To further enhance our system's security, we welcome community contributions via our open-source `elapse_secrets` library on our GitHub repository. [ElapseAI/elapse_secrets](https://github.com/ElapseAI/elapse_secrets)
