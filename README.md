## Introduction

Elapse is an AI-driven chatbot for Discord engineered to optimize your development process. It concentrates on a single language framework at a time and permits the merging of various Large Language Models (LLMs). Elapse provides precise, applicable, and relevant data to aid in project management effectively and efficiently. Discover the benefits of personalized support and our secure code masking procedure.

## Our Unique Approach

Conventional AI chatbots might lack in-depth specificity when trained on multiple languages and frameworks. To counteract this, Elapse offers a unique method where our chatbot focuses on one framework at a time. This creates a self-improving Large Language Model (LLM) that offers developers accurate and relevant data. Moreover, Elapse grants developers the ability to merge multiple LLMs, forming a personalized support system proficient in the selected languages or frameworks.

## Data Collection & Security 

Elapse ensures the privacy and security of your code via a method called code masking. This process converts your original code into an untraceable format. This transformed code is then processed by our AI-powered LLMs, and the response is translated back into a format that humans can understand. All these operations occur locally, providing an extra layer of security.

We also welcome community contributions to our open-source `elapse_secrets` library on GitHub to further strengthen our system's security. [ElapseAI/elapse_secrets](https://github.com/ElapseAI/elapse_secrets)
