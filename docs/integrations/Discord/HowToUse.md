# Elapse Custom Discord Bot Documentation

This document outlines fundamental instructions and best practices for integrating and using the Elapse bot in your Discord server.

## Introduction

Once you have successfully integrated the Elapse bot into your Discord server, there are a few key commands and procedures to be aware of for optimal usage and interaction.

## Commenting Messages

To prevent Elapse from processing a specific message, you can comment it out by prepending the message with `//`. Elapse will disregard any such messages.

**Example:**

```
// You can solve this by doing x and y
```

## Closing Threads

Threads can be marked as resolved using the `/close` command. This lets Elapse know that the content within that thread is ready for learning. Note that a thread can only be closed once and cannot be reopened after it's been closed.

**Example:**

```
/close
```

## Staff Roles

It is mandatory that all staff members share at least one role in common. The specific role to be used should be decided in consultation with the Elapse team to ensure proper integration. The shared role is a key part of Elapse's learning process.

To get assistance with this, please contact the Elapse team.

## Elapse Learning Process

Elapse is designed to learn and grow alongside your team. While it may not have immediate answers to all queries, it continually learns and improves over time. The goal is to eventually enable completely hands-off support operations. Be patient with Elapse, and it will provide invaluable service in the long run.

For any additional questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to the Elapse team for support.
