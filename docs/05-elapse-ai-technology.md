## Elapse AI Technology

Elapse AI leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to deliver customized enterprise solutions:

- **Transformer Architectures**: Models based on efficient self-attention for sequential data. Enables capturing long-range dependencies in text.

- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages general patterns learned during pre-training on large corpuses. Improves sample efficiency.

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Interactive learning from human feedback to align outputs with preferences.

- **Multimodal Learning**: Jointly models relationships between different data types like text, images, speech. Allows for versatile cross-domain applications.

- **Prompt Engineering**: Formulating inputs to elicit desired model behaviors without retraining. Facilitates easy customization.

- **Retrieval Augmentation**: Retrieves external knowledge to enrich model, prevent outdatedness.

- **Distillation**: Compresses models by transferring knowledge to smaller neural networks. Optimizes deployment.

- **Version Control**: Tracks incremental dataset and model changes enabling auditability.

- **Unified Model Serving**: Scalable, low-latency model deployment through optimized inference systems.

Combining established techniques with Elapse AI's own advances allows delivering performant, tailored enterprise solutions.
