## Data Collection & Security

Elapse ensures the privacy and security of your code via a method called code masking. This process converts your original code into an untraceable format. This transformed code is then processed by our AI-powered LLMs, and the response is translated back into a format that humans can understand. All these operations occur locally, providing an extra layer of security.

We also welcome community contributions to our open-source `elapse_secrets` library on GitHub to further strengthen our system's security. [ElapseAI/elapse_secrets](https://github.com/ElapseAI/elapse_secrets)
