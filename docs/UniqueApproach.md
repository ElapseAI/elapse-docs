## Our Unique Approach

Conventional AI chatbots might lack in-depth specificity when trained on multiple languages and frameworks. To counteract this, Elapse offers a unique method where our chatbot focuses on one framework at a time. This creates a self-improving Large Language Model (LLM) that offers developers accurate and relevant data. Moreover, Elapse grants developers the ability to merge multiple LLMs, forming a personalized support system proficient in the selected languages or frameworks.
